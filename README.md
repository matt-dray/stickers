# About

A place to store code for creating hex stickers and output images.

The hexes here were made using one of:

* [{hexSticker}](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) package by Guangchuang Yu
* [{magick}](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) and [{bunny}](https://github.com/dmi3kno/bunny) via Jeroen Ooms and Dmytro Perepolkin, respectively
* [The Hexmake Shiny app](https://connect.thinkr.fr/hexmake/) by Colin Fay

Code is in the `R/` subfolder; output images in `output/`. Image sources listed in [`img/README.md`](https://github.com/matt-dray/stickers/blob/master/img/README.md) and font sources listed in [`font/README.md`](https://github.com/matt-dray/stickers/blob/master/font/README.md).
